      Rules: <br><br>
      <i>
    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.<br>
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.<br>
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br>

    <i>
    John Horton Conway, a British mathematician, created the Game of Life in 1970.<br>
    His invention quickly gained popularity among computer enthusiasts and mathematicians,<br>
    who studied its emergent patterns and behaviors. Rest in peace, John Horton Conway.
